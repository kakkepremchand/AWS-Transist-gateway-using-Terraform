What is AWS Transit Gateway?

AWS Transit Gateway is a service that simplifies network connectivity for multiple Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. It acts as a hub that allows you to connect VPCs and VPN connections, enabling centralized management of network routing and traffic between these resources. This simplifies network architecture, improves scalability, and reduces operational complexity by providing a single gateway for routing traffic across multiple networks.


Example:

VPC 1: This VPC hosts a web application that needs to communicate with backend services in VPC 2 and also needs access to a shared database in VPC 3.
VPC 2: This VPC contains backend services such as application servers, databases, and message queues that support the web application in VPC 1.
VPC 3: This VPC hosts a shared database that is used by multiple applications and services, including the web application in VPC 1.


Using AWS Transit Gateway:

You deploy an AWS Transit Gateway in Region A.
You attach all three VPCs (VPC 1, VPC 2, and VPC 3) to the Transit Gateway.
You configure route tables in the Transit Gateway to allow communication between these VPCs.
The web application in VPC 1 can now securely communicate with backend services in VPC 2 through the Transit Gateway without requiring direct peering connections.
Similarly, the web application can access the shared database in VPC 3 via the Transit Gateway.
You can also connect on-premises networks or other VPCs from different regions to the Transit Gateway, enabling centralized network connectivity management.

This setup simplifies network architecture, reduces the number of peering connections, and provides a scalable and centralized solution for managing network traffic between multiple VPCs and external networks.
